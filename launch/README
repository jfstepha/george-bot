## 
## All code is hosted on Google Code.
## There are 2 versions:  devel and install.
## The devel is what I'm currently editing, the install should be the latest "working" copy. 

## To setup for local simulation mode:
source ~/setup_local_devel.sh

## or
source ~/setup_local_install.sh

## To setup to actually use the robot, run on both the host and the pi:
source ~/setup_pi_install.sh

## To run moveit:  (This crashes, have to try several times to get it to work)
roslaunch george moveit_live.sh
# hit "send" on the commander window to send the home state to the robot.


## To also run the gazebo simulator:
roslaunch george george_world.launch
# press the "play" button to start the simulation.
